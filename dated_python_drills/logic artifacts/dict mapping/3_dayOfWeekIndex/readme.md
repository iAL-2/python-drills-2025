# Drill: <Drill Name>

## Description
Create an index for days of the weeks to a number, then draft a function to allow safe lookup

## Concept Practiced
- `dict.get(key, default)` for safe lookup  
- [:n] for list slicing to allow function to cover more inputs
- used .lower() to allow case insensitivity, covering even more inputs
