# Python Drills 2025

This repo documents my journey toward coding fluency as I pivot into data engineering.
Instead of relying on tutorials, Iâ€™m building recall and problem-solving skills by
writing small programs from scratch.

Meta-work hours are defined as time spent researching and understanding the field, tutorials, and anything else outside of raw coding.


Each file is a self-contained drill:
- FizzBuzz variations
- Word frequency parser with CSV export
- QuadHex loop (string concat vs list join approaches)
- Menu-driven CLI program
