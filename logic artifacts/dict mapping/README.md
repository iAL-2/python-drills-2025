2. **HTTP Codes** – Applied `dict.get()` in real world context
3. **Days of Week** – `dict.get()` with string slicing and normalization
4. **Letter Grades** - `dict.get()` variation with integer division
5. **FizzBuzzMulti** - FizzBuzz variation with dict mapping using `.items()`. Explores difference in loop statements vs comprehension/generator expressions(comprehensive)
6. **RomanNumerals** - Turns a number into roman equivalent. 2 versions, `dict.get()` for the basic, while advanced version uses a loopstatement with `divmod()` to cover from 1-3999 for roman numerals. Also explores the `"string"*integer` function of python. 
7. **RomanNumeralsReversed** - Reads a roman numeral and turns it into an integer
8. **WordFrequencyParser** - Counts how many times a word is in a string, creates a dictionary map. Introduces mapping accumulation pattern. Includes advanced pipeline version(comprehensive)
