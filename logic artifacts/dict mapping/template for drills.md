# Drill: <Drill Name>

## Description
Briefly describe the goal of the drill.  
Example: *Convert a number (1–12) into its month abbreviation using a dictionary lookup.*

## Concept Practiced
- What programming concept or pattern is being reinforced?  
Example: Using a dictionary (`dict`) as a mapping table instead of chained `if/elif`.

## Key Idioms
- `dict.get(key, default)` for safe lookup  
- Iterating with `for k, v in mapping.items()` (if relevant)  
- Assigning new entries dynamically (if relevant)

## Why It Matters
Explain in 2–3 sentences why this pattern is important in real coding.  
Example: *Data-driven substitution keeps logic short and extensible, avoids branching, and makes rules easy to modify or scale.*
