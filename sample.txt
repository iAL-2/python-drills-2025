Logic Block — One Page, Soup Only

Goal: Fetch one page of quotes and save quote,author to quotes.csv.

Input: start_url = "https://quotes.toscrape.com/"

Output: CSV file with header quote,author.

Flow:

Fetch HTML → get the page’s HTML as a string.

Parse with BeautifulSoup:

For each div.quote, get:

span.text → quote text (strip the fancy quotes).

small.author → author name.

Collect rows as list of dicts or tuples.

Write CSV with your existing csv.writer.

Invariant check: rows_written == len(rows).

Edge cases:

If fetch fails → print error, write header only, stop.

If a quote block is missing fields → skip it.

Tests:

Smoke: On success, CSV exists, has header, and len(rows) > 0.

Parser unit test: run parse_quotes() on a small saved HTML sample and assert expected pairs found.
